# Purpose
"""
We are going through all four datasets and randomly selecting a small number of emails from each for manual testing. 
These emails will serve as test data to quickly check how well our logic performs.

Processing 
For each dataset, we manually pick a few random emails (around 20â€“50, depending on the dataset size) and 
save them into folders according to their file type.

# Saving the Sampled Datasets

The sampled emails are saved into separate folders based on dataset and type, for example:  
- Test Datasets/cleaned SA
- Test Datasets/cleaned Enron
- Test Datasets/raw SA
- Test Datasets/raw Enron

Each email is saved as an individual '.txt' file, labeled sequentially from 1 to 20.
Each email is saved as an individual '.eml' file, labeled sequentially from 1 to 20.
